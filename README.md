# Introduction to Software Engineering

This course is a framework to help an experienced software engineer introduce a complete novice to the field. My goal is to give a taste, not just of programming, but of the processes and tools that software engineers use to deliver products that are both valuable and high quality.

## What is Software Engineering?

Software engineering is more than just programming. Software engineers apply engineering best practices and a knowledge of science, technology, and math to real world problems through programming. This course will not make you a software engineer, but it will give you a taste of what it is like to be one.

## Why Include a Mentor?

I structured this material as a collaboration between a learner and an experienced mentor for at least three reasons. First, a mentor provides a richer experience for the learner. A mentor can personalize the material and branch out into paths that the learner would never have taken on their own.

Second, this setup simulates the feel of an actual development team. Specifically, the mentor provides code reviews for the learner.

Third, having a mentor involved allows me to keep this material much more simple. I don't need to explain how to setup Visual Studio Code on Windows vs MacOx vs Linux. I can let the mentor guide the learner through setting up their development environment. I don't need to predict the myriad of ways that a new learner might get tripped up. I can rely on the mentor to help the learner work through those issues we all hit when we first learn programming.

## Technical Jargon

Since this is intended for people with no programming or engineering background, I will keep the technical jargon to a minimum and I ask that any mentors do the same. My goal is to introduce core concepts in a simplified way. When and if a learner chooses to pursue a career in software engineering, my hope is that concepts like Agile, DevOps, Test Driven Development (TDD), and others will seem strangely familiar.
