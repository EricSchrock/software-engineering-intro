# Learning Python

Before we explore some of the basic concepts of software engineering, you do need to know the basics of a programming language. We will start by learning [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/) tutorial.

You do not have the make it all the way through the tutorial before beginning the rest of this course. I recommend making it through at least chapter 35 of the tutorial before starting the rest of this course in parallel.
