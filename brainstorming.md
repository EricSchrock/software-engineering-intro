Brainstorm new stories

Increase odds of favorites being chosen
Increase odds of restaurants in the same style as favorite being chosen
Acceptance Criteria: favorite restaurant more likely to be chosen than style of favorite
Decrease or remove blacklisted items for the group
Option to set group size rather than number of groups
Option to split significant others (default to not splitting)
Using command line args and function arg defaults
Say you want to use this feature with a bunch of cousins but you don't want to end up with all siblings in one group. Set max number of siblings.
Add generic blacklist (passed into script call)
This exercise would be best done in person to be more interactive. Maybe start with sticky notes but then copy things into GitHub projects of student's fork.
