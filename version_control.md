Pull Requests and Code Reviews

Have him submit the initial project baseline for a PR and review it. All future changes should also be on their own branch and be reviewed as part of the PR.

Mentors should look for opportunities to teach and introduce new things during PRs, but at an appropriate pace (e.g. using with blocks to avoid leaving file pointers open).

Putting it into practice

Create a basic program that chooses a random restaurant from restaurants.txt.

Include a list of useful functions like `readlines()` with links to the Python docs.

Should be done on a separate branch that can be PR'ed into master.

Include instructions on how to fork this repo.

How to get help

Link to Python docs with explanation of how to search and when they will be helpful (e.g. you know the function name but not how to use it). Link to Stack Overflow with explanation of how to use it (e.g. Google what you are trying to do).
