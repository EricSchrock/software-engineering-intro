1. List out new features to add (use the stories created in module 8).
2. Give each feature a "usefulness" or "value" score between one and five.
3. Order features by difficulty. Then explain and use relative sizing with modified fibonacci. Make the middle feature a five and then set the difficulty of the other features in comparison.
4. Explain and calculate priority = "usefulness" / "difficulty". Reorder features by priority.
5. See if any stories block each other and reorder priority appropriately (priority inversions).
Do the initial prioritization exercise in person with sticky notes, but have each feature written up as a story in markdown. Include acceptance criteria and definition of done (explain what these mean).

Goal is to maximize value. Goal is to deliver as much value as fast as possible (we can't implement every possible feature, we need to pick the right ones).
