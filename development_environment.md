# Setting Up Your Development Environment

A development environment is the set of tools that allow you write and test code. For this course we will use Visual Studio Code.

## Installing Python 3

In this course, we will write our code in Python 3.

Before installing Python 3, see if it is already installed. Open your terminal and run the following command.

```bash
python3
```

If Python3 is installed, Python will start up. To close Python, run the following command.

```python
quit()
```

If Python 3 is not installed, go to [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website and download the latest version of Python 3.

## Install Visual Studio Code

In this course, we will use Visual Studio Code as our development environment. It will provide the text editor that we use to write our code as well as the terminal we use to run it. Download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.

Visual Studio Code is fairly simple out of the box, but there are many extensions that can be added. Open the Extensions Marketplace and install the Python extension.

## Hello World

Create a new folder called `python_tutorial` and open it as a workspace in Visual Studio Code. Create a new file called `hello.py` and add the following line.

```python
print("Hello world!")
```

Run `hello.py` in the Visual Studio Code terminal.

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

Congratulations! You've just written your first program.
